# dgcf-hacktools

Data extraction/injection tools that could be used in a translation of the PC visual novel "Di Gi Charat Fantasy".

Massively incomplete at the moment, please be patient.

Compilation prerequisites are zlib and libpng.

## To-do

- Tool improvements
  - Make packing modified files more convenient. Some kind of pack list instead of just packing everything in a dir
- Game hacking
  - Support ASCII dialogue in scripts, possibly with variable-width fonts
  - Use on-disk audio files instead of CD-DA BGM
