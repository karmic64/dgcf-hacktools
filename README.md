# dgcf-hacktools

Data extraction/injection tools that could be used in a translation of the PC visual novel "Di Gi Charat Fantasy".

Massively incomplete at the moment, please be patient.

Compilation prerequisites are zlib and (eventually) libpng.

## To-do

- Tool improvements
  - Graphics conversion, from native `.grp`<->`.png`
- Game hacking
  - Support ASCII dialogue in scripts, possibly with variable-width fonts
  - Use on-disk audio files instead of CD-DA BGM
